# robbot

My Discord bot for my server *con amigos*. Don't look directly at my code; you may be blinded by its inefficiency.

## Installation instructions

Don't. Spare yourself the trouble, I'm pretty sure most of this spaghetti code only works because I pray several times a day that it won't break. If you really still want to give it a shot, put your bot token in `config.py` and run `bot.py`.
